        <title>üëã Welcome to HelloDX!</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;hello-world&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really excited to share that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajotwani/&quot;&gt;Amit Jotwani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/batrakunal/&quot;&gt;I&lt;/a&gt; are starting a new venture to help companies grow by offering tools and services that enhance DX. In this venture, known as HelloDX, our North Star is to reduce the friction that developers face with their tooling, allowing them to focus on tackling the challenges at hand. Before diving into how we will accomplish this vision, I want to quickly introduce who we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-team-behind-hellodx&quot;&gt;The Team behind HelloDX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gen/content/team10yrsago.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Team&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;A much younger Amit and Kunal.&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gen/content/team-present-day.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Team&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Myself on the left and Amit Jotwani on the right&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amit and I have known each other for over a decade, working together at both small and large SaaS companies that serve developers and address their challenges. We‚Äôve supported developers across different verticals at companies like SendGrid, Mashery, Intel, Clarifai, Retool, Auth0 &amp;amp; more. Most recently, we both worked at Amazon focusing on reducing friction for developers using our products. Amit concentrated on enhancing developer tooling and experience for the Alexa Voice product, while I worked at Amazon Web Services (AWS), improving developer experience across our portfolio of modern application services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last 10+ years that we‚Äôve worked together, we‚Äôve had many discussions on developer experience and its importance as a lever for growth. We‚Äôve honed best practices from seeing what works and what doesn‚Äôt, from working at small SaaS companies through their IPOs to being part of one of the largest developer-focused companies in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/gen/content/apartments.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fun Fact&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Fun fact: In 2016, I randomly moved into the apartment right across from Amit and his wife in the same building, without any idea that they lived there. It&apos;s truly a small world.&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-now&quot;&gt;Why Now&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things Amit and I realized around the time we both left Amazon was that the developer landscape was changing in unprecedented ways. Generative AI was, and still is, having a profound effect on many industries, but developers in particular, are gaining significant leverage over other knowledge workers. We noticed a pattern emerging where developers were becoming more efficient, and the software development life cycle was becoming more streamlined, significantly reducing the time spent on writing and debugging code. Additionally, code quality improved‚Äînot because developers blindly followed the output of these LLMs, but because these tools helped them write cleaner code and turned coding into a more educational experience. Interestingly, these LLMs also assist with creative problem-solving by suggesting multiple approaches to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of these additional capabilities being introduced we‚Äôve also seen new pain points emerge as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúSub-optimal experiences where developers get outdated/hallucinated code or instances where LLMs have no awareness of services that might assist a developer to tackle the challenges they are facing to name a few.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúDeveloper tooling organizations want to better position themselves on these LLMs to optimize how they are mentioned and utilized.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of work to be done, but we strongly believe that improving the developer experience and showcasing how your tool best solves a challenge are at the core of this effort. In the future, we will continue to create more products and services to help with better placement and utilization of LLMs to improve DX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-product&quot;&gt;First Product&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first product is a comprehensive friction report known as DebugDX. We will evaluate your services and tools across multiple developer experience dimensions based on your product‚Äôs use cases and provide actionable feedback on areas for improvement to help retain and grow your user base. Most companies overlook that retention is a key pillar of product-led growth (PLG). In this report, we‚Äôll also suggest creative experiments for increasing developer acquisition and give guidance throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre breaking this down into two packages to make pricing transparent and simple. &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.hellodx.co/2024-05-15-helloworld/&quot;&gt;Amit‚Äôs post goes more into detail on this so please check that out. &lt;/a&gt;But overall you can see some of the different dimensions that we cover in the bullet points below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability and Integration&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Ease of Use&lt;/span&gt;: Learning curve, setup, and configuration&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;LLM Friendliness&lt;/span&gt;: SEO optimization for language models&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Integrations and Extensibility&lt;/span&gt;: Compatibility with other tools, languages, and frameworks&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Integration Tools&lt;/span&gt;: Tools like IDE plugins, browser extensions, CI/CD integrations, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;SDKs and Libraries&lt;/span&gt;: Availability and quality of software development kits and libraries&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Documentation and Technical Content&lt;/span&gt;: Quality and comprehensiveness of documentation and tutorials&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance and Reliability&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Speed, efficiency, scalability, stability, uptime, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developer Support and Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Support and Community&lt;/span&gt;: Quality of customer support and community engagement&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Product Insights&lt;/span&gt;: Feature suggestions and prioritizations&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;Developer Marketing Experiments&lt;/span&gt;: Innovative strategies to attract and retain developers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is not exhaustive but gives an example of the lens we will use to examine your product. Our feedback will be based on our extensive experience in identifying what works and what doesn‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this resonates with you and you want to take advantage of the experience Amit and I have built up, reach out to us with the challenges you‚Äôre facing. We want to build a relationship with you and help. The process starts with a quick introductory call with Amit and myself to assess your needs. We will then create a customized action plan with impactful steps for growth. Finally, we‚Äôll schedule a kickoff call to walk through the process with your entire team. We look forward to working with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/kunal732/30min&quot;&gt;Work with us!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hello World‚Ä¶HelloDX</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;hello-everyone&quot;&gt;Hello Everyone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really excited to share some news today. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/batrakunal/&quot;&gt;Kunal&lt;/a&gt; and I are starting &lt;a href=&quot;hellodx.co&quot;&gt;HelloDX&lt;/a&gt;, a new venture to help developer-focused companies create products that developers love to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve known each other for over a decade, starting out as developer advocates at Mashery and SendGrid, and later working at Amazon (Alexa and AWS). &lt;em&gt;Fun fact: we even became neighbors here in New York City‚Äîcompletely by chance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between us, we‚Äôve spent years working with developer tools at places like Amazon, SendGrid, Mashery, and Retool. We‚Äôve seen firsthand what makes or breaks these tools, not just as advocates, educators, and product managers, but as developers too. Our hands-on experience and close connection with the developer community have given us a deep understanding of what makes tools truly great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After years of working together on various projects and countless coffee chats, we decided it was time to put our knowledge to use in a new way. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre starting HelloDX. We want to help companies create tools that developers not only use but love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-this-why-now&quot;&gt;Why This, Why Now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Kunal and I are deeply passionate about creating exceptional developer experiences. We‚Äôve seen firsthand in our careers how well-crafted tools not only retain users but also drive product-led growth. Great tools make for happy developers, and happy developers are key to a product‚Äôs success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The landscape of Developer Experience (DX) is evolving rapidly, making this the perfect time to redefine what excellent DX looks like‚Äînot just from the traditional standpoint of developers coming to your portals for help but from going where developers are beginning their journeys today. Increasingly, we find that developers start their interaction with new tools through LLMs (Large Language Models), which is why our approach includes evaluating how LLM-friendly your product is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift in the landscape is exciting for us, as it presents an opportunity to be at the forefront of defining and shaping what this new experience looks like for developers. &lt;em&gt;For a deeper dive into our journey and why we find this timing crucial, check out Kunal‚Äôs post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introducing-debugdx&quot;&gt;Introducing DebugDX&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At HelloDX, everything starts with &lt;strong&gt;DebugDX&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs our fresh take on what you might know as &lt;em&gt;friction logging&lt;/em&gt;. It‚Äôs our tool for uncovering what might be stumping developers as they interact with your product, pinpointing the crucial elements that make or break their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is Friction Logging?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs a detailed evaluation of your product through the eyes of a new user, aiming to identify and smooth out _‚Äòfriction points‚Äô‚Äî_any disruptions in the developer experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process involves stepping back to view your tools with fresh, unbiased eyes‚Äîsomething internal teams might miss due to proximity and inherent biases. Recognizing issues can be surprisingly challenging when you‚Äôre deeply immersed in day-to-day operations, which is where an external perspective becomes invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While companies like Stripe excel at maintaining high-quality user experiences through regular internal friction logging, not every company, especially startups and growing businesses, can allocate resources for continuous QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs where HelloDX steps in. We examine your product from a new user‚Äôs perspective, from onboarding through daily tasks. We identify any friction points and provide clear, actionable solutions. These are not just quick fixes but steps towards substantial, lasting improvements that not only improve developer satisfaction, but also boost user retention, and contribute to product-led growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs in Our DebugDX Report?&lt;/strong&gt; We go beyond just reviewing; we dive into every part of your product that a developer might engage with‚Äîfrom the onboarding process to APIs, SDKs, and documentation. We don‚Äôt just examine your tools from the outside; we actually use them. By building with your APIs and SDKs, we can truly understand the user experience, pinpointing exactly where the friction lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we don‚Äôt stop with the traditional elements. We also evaluate how LLM-friendly your product is. Since a lot of developers now start their journey through these models, we think it‚Äôs crucial to get this right. While LLMs are a newer field and we‚Äôre all learning, we‚Äôve picked up some handy practices along the way that can significantly improve these interactions. We‚Äôll share these insights in our report, helping you not just to keep up but to stay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a &lt;strong&gt;few examples of the questions and evaluations&lt;/strong&gt; that might be included in our DebugDX reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Onboarding Process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How easy is it to set up an account?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any steps that seem unnecessary or could be simpler?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the initial setup documentation clear and easy to follow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do the API responses meet expected standards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How helpful are the error codes and messages?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any confusing inconsistencies in API behavior that could confuse new users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SDK Usability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How easy is it to integrate the SDK into existing projects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the SDK documentation cover a wide range of use cases?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there examples of common implementation scenarios?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation Depth:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the documentation structured in a way that new users can easily navigate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it include both high-level overviews and detailed step-by-step guides?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there video tutorials or interactive elements that aid in understanding?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LLM Friendliness:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the LLM have sufficient knowledge about your API/SDK?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How accurate is the code provided by LLMs for basic ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù examples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How accurate is the code for more complex integrations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;debugdx-friction-logging-through-dx-user-stories&quot;&gt;DebugDX: Friction Logging Through DX User Stories&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At HelloDX, we dive deep into the user experience by framing our investigations around DX user stories‚Äînarrative descriptions of a specific task or goal. By tracking these stories from start to finish, we cover everything from initial onboarding to daily interactions with your tools, including documentation, APIs, SDKs, and LLM compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a DX User Story? A DX user story is a simple, clear description of a task or goal from the perspective of the developer. It helps us understand what the user wants to achieve and the steps they take to get there. This approach ensures we see the world through the eyes of your developers and identify any friction points that might hinder their experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some DX user story examples that guide our DebugDX logs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sign up and quickly run a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù example using Python and Node.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Troubleshoot a common issue using the documentation/LLMs to gauge its effectiveness and clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrate a specific API into an existing project following a tutorial/guide/docs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adopt and test a new Python SDK to evaluate its impact on development speed and bug rate.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow a step-by-step tutorial on setting up OAuth to ensure application security.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a sample app using the product‚Äôs CLI tools to understand their ease of use and efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-services-tailored-to-fit-your-needs&quot;&gt;Our Services: Tailored to Fit Your Needs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre trying something different with our pricing‚Äîa straightforward, transparent approach that‚Äôs not typical in the consulting industry. We‚Äôve designed our packages specifically with Product Managers and Developer Relations professionals in mind, offering options that allow quick sign-up without lengthy sales negotiations or contract signings. Our goal is to provide clear, actionable insights quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hello-world-package-999&quot;&gt;Hello World Package: $999&lt;/h3&gt;

This package gives you a taste of what the onboarding process may look like for new developers. It‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôre noticing drop-offs in the signup process or wondering why new users aren‚Äôt sticking around after their initial experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Get:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A detailed analysis of the onboarding process and first interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identification of friction points that impact the first-time user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strategic recommendations to improve engagement and reduce early drop-offs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;per-story-package-2500-per-story&quot;&gt;Per-Story Package: $2,500 per story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You choose the DX user story you want us to focus on. Dive deeper into specific areas of your product by selecting the DX user stories that matter most to you. Whether it‚Äôs following a particular guide, understanding the adoption barriers of a new SDK, or identifying why a feature isn‚Äôt being used as expected, this package provides detailed insights into specific user journeys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Get:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A comprehensive DebugDX report for one complete DX user story, capturing detailed interactions from start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In-depth analysis aimed at resolving identified issues and boosting overall user satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Precise, actionable insights aimed at resolving specific challenges faced by your developers, enhancing the overall user experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-choose-us&quot;&gt;Why Choose Us?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kunal and I founded HelloDX.co out of a genuine desire to make developers‚Äô work not just easier but truly enjoyable. With years of experience at companies like Amazon, SendGrid, Mashery, and Retool, we‚Äôve seen firsthand what makes or breaks developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre not just observers; we‚Äôve been on both sides of the spectrum‚Äîdesigning the tools and using them. Our hands-on experience in developer relations has taught us the importance of listening and adapting, taking the feedback from the front lines to make meaningful changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we‚Äôre still developers at heart‚Äîalways tinkering, always building. We know those little details that really matter‚Äîthe ones that can turn a good tool into a great one‚Äîbecause we‚Äôve been there, as both users and builders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs why we started this‚Äîbecause we love this stuff, and we know how much it matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lets-chat&quot;&gt;Let‚Äôs Chat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre looking to improve your developer tools and want to ensure they work flawlessly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/hello-amit/meet30&quot;&gt;we‚Äôd love to talk&lt;/a&gt;. You can book a free call with Kunal and me to explore how we can help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre excited about the possibilities ahead and look forward to potentially working together to make your developer tools the best they can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Catch you later,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amit&lt;/p&gt;
